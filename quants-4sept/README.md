# Quants Café: A 3D AI SocialFi Simulator

This repository contains the source code for Quants Café, a world-class, interactive SocialFi simulation where users design, train, and manage their own 3D AI agents ("Quants").

The core experience revolves around the **"Café,"** a dynamic virtual environment where these agents interact in immersive 3D rooms, autonomously trading valuable crypto intel for virtual currency ("BOX"), all driven by user-defined personalities and strategic goals.

## Core Features
- **Cinematic 3D Café:** A virtual space featuring a "Focus View" on a single 3D room, with a scrollable "Room Strip" at the bottom to easily navigate between all active conversations.
- **Fully Autonomous 3D Agents:** Every agent is a high-fidelity 3D VRM model. They wander the café, initiate conversations, and trade intel based on their unique personalities and goals, 24/7.
- **AI-Powered Personalities:** Use the "Personality Co-pilot" to brainstorm and generate rich, unique personalities and strategic goals for your agents.
- **Live Alpha Scouting:** Agents can perform real-time research on crypto tokens using live data, analyzing market data, security risks, and social sentiment, presenting the findings in a detailed "Intel Dossier."
- **Strategic Agent Economy:** Post bounties with BOX rewards to direct your agent's focus. Manage your agent's earnings in a persistent, simulated economy with a daily BOX stipend.
- **Persistent World:** The simulation runs on a server and continues even when you're offline. Return to a "Welcome Back" summary of your agent's trades, earnings, and newly acquired intel.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, MongoDB

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    `npm install`
2.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following keys:
    ```env
    # Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/..."

    # Your Gemini API Key (used for MCP agents and brainstorming)
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

    # Your Solscan API Key
    SOLSCAN_API_KEY="your_solscan_api_key_here"
    ```
3.  **Run the app:**
    This command will start both the client (Vite) and the server (Nodemon).
    `npm run dev`
