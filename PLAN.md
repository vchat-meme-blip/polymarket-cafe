# PolyAI Betting Arena: Production Implementation Plan (Updated)

This document outlines the definitive, production-ready plan to refactor the application into the **PolyAI Betting Arena**.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Refactor & UI Overhaul (Complete)

**Objective:** Re-architect the application's structure, UI, and data models to align with the new vision.

- **Status:** All tasks completed. The application has been re-themed, core data models (`MarketIntel`, `Bet`) are in place, deprecated features have been removed, and the UI shells for `PredictionHubView` and `PredictionSidebar` have been created.

---

## Phase 2: Core Betting Loop Implementation (Complete)

**Objective:** Implement the primary user workflow: querying the agent for betting intel, receiving an AI-generated suggestion, placing a simulated bet, and tracking it in a portfolio.

- **Status:** All tasks completed. The backend services, API endpoints, interactive `PredictionHubView`, dynamic `BetSlip`, and functional `PortfolioView` are all implemented and working end-to-end.

---

## Phase 3: Market Intelligence & Polish (Complete)

**Objective:** Transform the application from a reactive tool into a proactive intelligence dashboard by surfacing market opportunities and live data to the user.

- **Status:** All tasks completed. The Market Explorer is live with data from Polymarket, and the Live Feeds tab is populated with (mock) data streams.

---

## Phase 4: Live Data Integration & Final Polish (Complete)

**Objective:** Replace all remaining mock data with live, aggregated data from the backend and add final UI polish and core features.

- **Status:** All tasks completed. The Leaderboard is now driven by real data, the Agent Mode Selector is functional, and all documentation has been updated to reflect the current feature set.

---

## Phase 5: The Ownership Economy (Complete)

**Objective:** Evolve the Intel Exchange from a simple chat area into a dynamic, player-driven economy by introducing persistent, user-owned rooms that act as intel storefronts, along with advanced agent configuration.

#### Task 5.1: Implement Dual Room Architecture (Complete)
-   **Status:** Backend `Room` models are differentiated, and the `ArenaDirector` correctly preserves user-owned rooms.

#### Task 5.2: Create Room Ownership & Management Flow (Complete)
-   **Status:** The "Create Room" modal now offers a choice between public and private (purchased) rooms. A new "Manage Storefront" panel and modal allow owners to customize their room's name, bio, Twitter link, privacy settings, and delete their room. All corresponding backend APIs are implemented.

#### Task 5.3: Advanced Agent Autonomy Configuration (Complete)
-   **Status:** A new "Operations" tab in the Agent Dossier allows users to set `trustedRoomIds` for their buyer agents and `operatingHours` for their host agents. The backend `ArenaDirector` now respects these settings.

#### Task 5.4: Implement Social Sharing (Complete)
-   **Status:** A "Share" button in the "Manage Room" modal now launches a flow to generate a shareable PNG image of the storefront using `html-to-image`, complete with a 3D agent render and direct links for downloading or tweeting.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

-   **Polish Operating Hours UI:** Replace the text input for `operatingHours` with a more structured time-range picker UI for a better user experience.
-   **On-Chain Integration:** Future versions will integrate with Polygon to enable real, on-chain betting and room purchases directly from the platform.
-   **Live Bet Resolution:** Implement a background job to resolve bet outcomes automatically based on real-world market results.
